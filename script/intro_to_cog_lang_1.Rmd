This session is made up of a number of videos and links to various resources that I hope you'll find interesting. You can download the slides that you see in each of the videos in either .pdf or .odp format by clicking on the appropriate link that follows each of the videos. The videos are recorded in 1080p resolution, so please do watch them in full screen mode. The audio I've recorded using a podcasting microphone and I recommend you listen with headphones. YouTube generates subtitles automatically and I suggest you turn them on. Most of the time the subtitles are very accurate - but occassionally they can go very wrong!

The next video provides an overview of Electroencephalography (EEG). We use this technique a lot in language processing research.
